# Toyota/Lexus RAG Assistant

A simple RAG assistant that combines vehicle sales data and documents to answer automotive questions. Built with LangGraph, LanceDB, and SQLite.

## What it does

This assistant can:

- **Query Sales Data**: Answer questions about vehicle sales using SQL
- **Search Documents**: Find information in manuals, contracts, and warranties
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically direct questions to the right tools
- **Safety**: Basic content filtering for safe interactions

## How it works

```
User Question → Safety Check → Route to Tools → Generate Answer
                              ├─ SQL Database (sales data)
                              ├─ Document Search (PDFs)
                              └─ Clarification/Redirect
```
