    description="""Use this tool to answer questions about Toyota/Lexus sales data using secure, parameterized queries.

This tool accepts natural language questions about:
- Sales by model (e.g., "RAV4 sales in Germany 2024")
- Sales by country/region (e.g., "Toyota sales in Europe 2024")
- Powertrain analysis (e.g., "hybrid vehicle sales 2024")
- Sales trends and comparisons (e.g., "monthly sales trends 2024")
- Top performers (e.g., "top 10 models by sales")
- Model comparisons (e.g., "Toyota vs Lexus sales")

The tool automatically converts your question into secure SQL queries with proper parameterization.
All queries use read-only database access and are protected against SQL injection.

Examples:
- "What were RAV4 sales in Germany in 2024?"
- "Show me Toyota sales by powertrain in 2024"
- "Compare Lexus sales across European countries"
- "What are the top 5 performing models this year?"
- "Show me monthly sales trends for hybrid vehicles"

The tool supports years 2020-2024 and includes data for major markets worldwide.
